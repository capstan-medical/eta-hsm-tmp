# eta-hsm

A C++ state machine library written for C++ 17

# Interview Project.

## Task

We would like you to setup a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a small library hosted on GitHub.  Exactly what you include in the CI pipeline is up to you but some suggestions are:

    linting

    format/style checking

    compilation

    unit test execution

    static analysis

    documentation generation

## Presentation

At the end of the allotted time, we would like you to give a presentation to the interview panel explaining and showcasing what you were able to accomplish in this limited exercise.  Remember that the interview panel is a mixture of software developers, non-software engineers, and non-engineers.  Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

    what you did

    why you did it

    what else you would do given more time

Given the time limitation of this exercise, the presentation is not expected to be formal or polished.  Please focus on content and meaningful communication.

## Background Details
 

GitHub - capstan-medical/eta-hsm-tmp: C++ State Machine Library  

eta-hsm is a C++ state machine library that we use here at Capstan.  It is an open-source project and we have created a dedicated fork (linked above) for your use today.  The capstan-software-interviewee user has been given god-level access to this fork, so you should be able to do just about anything you want to within the fork without fear of messing anything else up. 

In addition to the primary C++ library, this project also contains a small python utility used for diagramming state machines written with the C++ library.  Specific suggested tasks beyond testing of the primary C++ library (as time permits) include:

    generation and publication of state machine diagrams for the provided examples

    packaging and distribution of the python utility

This particular library makes heavy use of modern C++ features such as templates, which is expected to be beyond the scope of this interview.  If you run into template-related compilation issues, please ask for help immediately.
Rules

You may:

    Use the internet to look up documentation and examples

    Use AI to generate small code snippets (think the size thing you might copy from a stack overflow post)

    Please notate the source (informally is fine, e.g. Claude, StakcOverflow, etc…) for anything that you copy-paste from any source.

    Ask any member of the software team or interview panel for help, advice, or input.  

Please do not:

    Look at any existing CI pipelines that might exist for other forks of this repo.  (they’re not any good anyway)

    Use AI to generate significant code, scripts, or configurations
